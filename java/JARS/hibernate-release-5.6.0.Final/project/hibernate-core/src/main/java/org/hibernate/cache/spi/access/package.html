    Defines contracts for transactional and concurrent access to cached
    {@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.access.EntityDataAccess entity} and
    {@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.access.CollectionDataAccess collection} data. Transactions pass in a
    timestamp indicating transaction start time which is then used to protect against concurrent access (exactly how
    that occurs is based on the actual access-strategy impl used). Two different implementation patterns are provided
    for:
<ul>
        <li>
            A transaction-aware cache implementation might be wrapped by a <i>synchronous</i> access strategy,
            where updates to the cache are written to the cache inside the transaction.
        </li>
        <li>
            A non-transaction-aware cache would be wrapped by an <i>asynchronous</i> access strategy, where items
            are merely "soft locked" during the transaction and then updated during the "after transaction completion"
            phase; the soft lock is not an actual lock on the database row - only upon the cached representation of the
            item.
        </li>
    </ul>
    The <i>asynchronous</i> access strategies are: {@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.access.AccessType#READ_ONLY read-only},
    {@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.access.AccessType#READ_WRITE read-write} and
    {@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.access.AccessType#NONSTRICT_READ_WRITE nonstrict-read-write}.  The only
    <i>synchronous</i> access strategy is {@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.access.AccessType#TRANSACTIONAL transactional}.
</p>
<p>
    Note that, for an <i>asynchronous</i> cache, cache invalidation must be a two step process (lock->unlock or
    lock->afterUpdate), since this is the only way to guarantee consistency with the database for a nontransactional
    cache implementation. For a <i>synchronous</i> cache, cache invalidation is a single step process (evict or update).
    Hence, these contracts ({@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.access.EntityRegionAccessStrategy} and
    {@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.access.CollectionRegionAccessStrategy}) define a three step process to cater for both
    models (see the individual contracts for details).
</p>
<p>
    Note that query result caching does not go through an access strategy; those caches are managed directly against
    the underlying {@link org.hibernate.cache.spi.QueryResultsRegion}.
