EWKTReader doesn't work with the test data for Z or M data. It tests for 'POINTM' but the data is 'POINT M'.

TestSpatialFunctions failures:
transform:
DB2 transform functions between spatial reference systems with the same datum but not different datums.
This causes the transform test in TestSpatialFunctions to fail because it transforms from WGS84 to WGS_1972_Transit_Broadcast_Ephemeris
