== Preface

Hibernate is an https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping[Object/Relational Mapping] solution for Java environments.

Hibernate not only takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables (and from Java data types to SQL data types), but also provides data query and retrieval facilities.
It can significantly reduce development time otherwise spent with manual data handling in SQL and JDBC.
Hibernateâ€™s design goal is to relieve the developer from 95% of common data persistence-related programming tasks by eliminating the need for manual, hand-crafted data processing using SQL and JDBC.
However, unlike many other persistence solutions, Hibernate does not hide the power of SQL from you and guarantees that your investment in relational technology and knowledge is as valid as always.

=== Audience

This guide is for software developers and architects who will be integrating Hibernate with Java EE application servers, Spring framework, caching solutions (e.g. Infinispan, Ehcache, Hazelcast).
