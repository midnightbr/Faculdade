== Obtaining Hibernate

=== The Hibernate Modules/Artifacts

Hibernate's functionality is split into a number of modules/artifacts meant to isolate dependencies (modularity).

hibernate-core:: The main (core) Hibernate module.  Defines its ORM features and APIs as well as the various integration SPIs.
hibernate-envers:: Hibernate's historical entity versioning feature
hibernate-spatial:: Hibernate's Spatial/GIS data-type support
hibernate-osgi:: Hibernate support for running in OSGi containers.
hibernate-agroal:: Integrates the https://agroal.github.io/[Agroal] connection pooling library into Hibernate
hibernate-c3p0:: Integrates the https://www.mchange.com/projects/c3p0/[C3P0] connection pooling library into Hibernate
hibernate-hikaricp:: Integrates the https://github.com/brettwooldridge/HikariCP/[HikariCP] connection pooling library into Hibernate
hibernate-vibur:: Integrates the https://www.vibur.org/[Vibur DBCP] connection pooling library into Hibernate
hibernate-proxool:: Integrates the https://proxool.sourceforge.net/[Proxool] connection pooling library into Hibernate
hibernate-jcache:: Integrates the https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=107$$[JCache] caching specification into Hibernate,
enabling any compliant implementation to become a second-level cache provider.
hibernate-ehcache:: Integrates the https://ehcache.org/[Ehcache] caching library into Hibernate as a second-level cache provider.

=== Release Bundle Downloads

The Hibernate team provides release bundles hosted on the SourceForge File Release System, in both
`TGZ` and `ZIP` formats.  Each release bundle contains `JAR` files, documentation, source code, and other goodness.

You can download releases of Hibernate, in your chosen format, from the list at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/hibernate/files/hibernate-orm/.  The release bundle is structured as follows:

* The `lib/required/` directory contains the `hibernate-core` jar and all of its dependencies.  All of these jars are
required to be available on your classpath no matter which features of Hibernate are being used.
* The `lib/envers` directory contains the `hibernate-envers` jar and all of its dependencies (beyond those in
`lib/required/` and `lib/jpa/`).
* The `lib/spatial/` directory contains the `hibernate-spatial` jar and all of its dependencies (beyond those in `lib/required/`)
* The `lib/osgi/` directory contains the `hibernate-osgi` jar and all of its dependencies (beyond those in `lib/required/` and `lib/jpa/`)
* The `lib/jpa-metamodel-generator/` directory contains the jar needed for generating the Criteria API type-safe Metamodel.
* The `lib/optional/` directory contains the jars needed for the various connection pooling and second-level cache integrations
provided by Hibernate, along with their dependencies.

=== Maven Repository Artifacts

The authoritative repository for Hibernate artifacts is the JBoss Maven repository.  The Hibernate artifacts are
synced to Maven Central as part of an automated job (some small delay may occur).

The team responsible for the JBoss Maven repository maintains a number of Wiki pages that contain important information:

* https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-14900 - General information about the repository.
* https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15170 - Information about setting up the JBoss repositories in order to do
development work on JBoss projects themselves.
* https://community.jboss.org/docs/DOC-15169 - Information about setting up access to the repository to use JBoss
projects as part of your own software.

The Hibernate ORM artifacts are published under the `org.hibernate` groupId.
