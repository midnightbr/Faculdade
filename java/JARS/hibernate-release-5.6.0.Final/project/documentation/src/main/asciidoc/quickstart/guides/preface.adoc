== Preface

Working with both Object-Oriented software and Relational Databases can be cumbersome and time-consuming.
Development costs are significantly higher due to a number of "paradigm mismatches" between how data is represented in objects
versus relational databases.  Hibernate is an Object/Relational Mapping (ORM) solution for Java environments.  The
term Object/Relational Mapping refers to the technique of mapping data between an object model representation to
a relational data model representation.  See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping for a good
high-level discussion.  Also, Martin Fowler's link:$$https://martinfowler.com/bliki/OrmHate.html$$[OrmHate] article
takes a look at many of the mismatch problems.

Although having a strong background in SQL is not required to use Hibernate, having a basic understanding of the
concepts can help you understand Hibernate more quickly and fully.  An understanding of data modeling principles
is especially important.  Both https://www.agiledata.org/essays/dataModeling101.html and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_modeling are good starting points for understanding these data modeling
principles.  If you are completely new to database access in Java,
https://www.marcobehler.com/guides/a-guide-to-accessing-databases-in-java contains a good overview of the various parts,
pieces and options.

Hibernate takes care of the mapping from Java classes to database tables, and from Java data types to SQL data
types. In addition, it provides data query and retrieval facilities. It can significantly reduce development
time otherwise spent with manual data handling in SQL and JDBC.  Hibernateâ€™s design goal is to relieve the
developer from 95% of common data persistence-related programming tasks by eliminating the need for manual,
hand-crafted data processing using SQL and JDBC.  However, unlike many other persistence solutions, Hibernate
does not hide the power of SQL from you and guarantees that your investment in relational technology and
knowledge is as valid as always.

Hibernate may not be the best solution for data-centric applications that only use stored-procedures to
implement the business logic in the database, it is most useful with object-oriented domain models and business
logic in the Java-based middle-tier. However, Hibernate can certainly help you to remove or encapsulate
vendor-specific SQL code and streamlines the common task of translating result sets from a tabular
representation to a graph of objects.

See https://hibernate.org/orm/contribute/ for information on getting involved.
